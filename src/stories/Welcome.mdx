# GDSReact

This component library provides everything you need to use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) in your React projects.

**Read this guide first for setup instructions and troubleshooting.**

## Important Notice

### No Government Affiliation

This library is NOT maintained, endorsed, or supported by the UK Government. It is a community implementation of the designs and patterns created by the GOV.UK Design System team. While every care has been taken to remain faithful to the original design intentions, slight deviations may occur.

### GDS Transport Font

The [GDS Transport](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/11/can-i-use-the-gov-uk-fonts/) font is **only licensed for use on gov.uk subdomains**. If you're not building for gov.uk, the library will fall back to Arial.

For more information, see:
- [GDS Transport usage guidelines](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typeface/)
- [Making your service look like GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- React 19+
- govuk-frontend 5+
- `sass` or `sass-embedded` (for your bundler to process GOV.UK Frontend styles)

### Installation

1. **Install govuk-frontend:**
   ```bash
   pnpm add govuk-frontend
   ```

2. **Install gds-react:**
   ```bash
   pnpm add @projectsbyif/gds-react
   ```

3. **Set up assets (if building for gov.uk):**
   Follow the [guide to import font and image assets](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/import-font-and-images-assets/). Note the path you use (we recommend `/assets`).

## Usage

### Setup

Components load GOV.UK Frontend styles and JavaScript automatically. For styling to work correctly, add these CSS classes to your HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="govuk-template govuk-template--rebranded">
  <head>...</head>
  <body class="govuk-template__body js-enabled govuk-frontend-supported">
    <!-- Your React app -->
  </body>
</html>
```

**Required classes:**
- `govuk-template` and `govuk-template--rebranded` on `<html>` - Base template styles and refreshed GOV.UK branding (v5.10.0+)
- `govuk-template__body` on `<body>` - Body template styles
- `js-enabled` on `<body>` - Required for JS-dependent components (Accordion, Tabs, etc.)
- `govuk-frontend-supported` on `<body>` - Indicates modern JavaScript support

### Router Integration

Most React frameworks use a router for navigation, such as [Next.js Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) or [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

Use the `asChild` prop to integrate your router's Link component:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@projectsbyif/gds-react";
import NextLink from "next/link";

// Single link components - use asChild
<Link href="/dashboard" asChild>
  <NextLink>Dashboard</NextLink>
</Link>
```

For components with multiple links (Breadcrumbs, Footer, etc.), use the `renderLink` prop:

```tsx
import { Breadcrumbs } from "@projectsbyif/gds-react";
import NextLink from "next/link";

<Breadcrumbs
  items={[
    { text: "Home", href: "/" },
    { text: "Products", href: "/products" },
  ]}
  renderLink={(item, className) => (
    <NextLink href={item.href} className={className}>
      {item.text}
    </NextLink>
  )}
/>
```

See [Router Integration](?path=/docs/guides-router-integration--docs) for more examples with different frameworks.

## Troubleshooting

### Components aren't styled

- Check that [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) is installed correctly
- Ensure you have the required CSS classes on your `<html>` and `<body>` elements (see Setup section above)

### Fonts aren't loading

- Verify you've followed the [asset import guide](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/import-font-and-images-assets/) and that assets are accessible at your configured URL
- Check the browser console for errors

### Links aren't working as expected

- Use the `asChild` prop with your router's Link component
- For multi-link components, use the appropriate `renderLink` prop
- See [Router Integration](?path=/docs/guides-router-integration--docs) for examples
